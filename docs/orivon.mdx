# The Orivon Project

Welcome to the Orivon Project documentation, here you will find every bit of information you need to know about the project and how you can become part of it

So glad to have you here, here's the opportunity to take Web3 usage widespread across the entire world

## The Ultimate Web3 Browser

<img src={OrivonDashboardConcept} alt="OrivonDashboardConcept" width="800" style={{ display: "block" }}/>
<small style={{ display: "block", marginBottom: "1rem"  }}>Take this only as an experimental and illustrative image</small>

We believe we have created the perfect design for a truly web3 browsing system of the future and we share the Orivon Project ideals to make all of that true

The idea of a *truly web3* Browser looks like inevitable for the Web3 future and gives huge improvement in the User Experience, as well with huge improvement for developers experience to create Web3 apps

We are aware that our statements sound impressive, but once you learn more about Orivon you may start agreeing with these as well.

Feedbacks, questions, [discussions](https://orivonstack.com) or critiques are part of project for improvement and general web3 community knowledge sharing, feel free to share your opinion trough any of [our channels](more/our-channels)


### Web3 problems

One of first the problems preventing web3 mass adoption are *absence of ease and clarity*, peoples has no clue what is web3 and what's not (see FTX case on public opinion)

Using it is actually hard for common peoples, involves high risks for them, and mosts doesn't understand it's values and uses. Furthermore, the one most of us uses isn't event the actual trustless web3, but a trusted web2.5 temporary solution.

*Normal Browsers limitations prevents running most of web3 things on-fly*

By an user perspective, everything is disconnected, nothing provides a clear web3 experience worth of the big public attention

But it's understandable, technologies takes a while until *a way* to make them easily accessible is found, Orivon proposes to be *the way*.

Furthermore there are some other reasons preventing Web3 from getting worldwide widespread:

- **Peoples thinks it hasn't practical uses,** and we can't blame them for it, only tech users can understand web3 incredible value, when experiencing web3 will be easy for everyone, then everyone will understand once for all how game-changing it is
  

- **We use Web2 solutions to access Web3 protocols,** you open uniswap.com, you are using a centralized DNS, then you get site data from the Uniswap host (hoping it's not compromised), then maybe it goes well

  Big public can't look at Web3 seriously if it's current state is like this, we need to go truly Web3

- **Going truly web3 is for technicals,** running interfaces locally, installing programs (and for each of them set up a wallet), running nodes, installing trustless DEX'es like Bisq and all of these things are made mostly by technical users

  For each web3 operation *download install open setup*... what if we improve it to just *open*?  
  Improving it would allow the widespread adoption of Web3 socials, DeFi, Web3sites, and Web3 technologies in general

- **There aren't established ways to access web3 resources:** *how do I find web3 things? how do I know if its actually trustless? is that even safe?* These questions causes uncertainty and insecurity feeling on peoples

  That's why we need a straightforward place to access and search valid web3 resources


The fact is, we all know that these problems, along with Web2 solutions to access Web3 protocols, are just temporary and are going to be replaced when web3 community will come up with a better solution, but the solution is right here, it's called Orivon, and aims to solve exactly all of that

## Solution and revolution

<img src={OrivonBisqEasyConcept} alt="OrivonBisqEasyConcept" width="475"/> 
<small style={{ display: "block", marginBottom: "1rem"  }}>Take this only as an experimental and illustrative image</small>

Orivon gives a solution willing to change the entire Web3 Experience, both for users and developers

**Users** will benefit from an huge UX improvement, easy [search](#web3-search) and fast use of different web3 clients just by opening a url (ex. mastodon.eth), easily know how much trustless and safe the current visited site or the current operation is, eventually with a privacy indicator ([Web3 Scores](./implementations/web3-score)) 

On-fly web3 things support will make it a lot seamless and straightforward for the user

Feeling chill and safe into the Web3 has never been that easy  

**Developers** will benefit from a divine time saving, needing to build only frontend and their protocol, stuffs like wallet management, network management and security is already handled by Orivon, no more need of unnecessary work  

Special Extensions, like Wallet (expand wallet capabilities) or Network management (to add new network, like Ethereum or Torrent) will be very easy inside the Orivon dev framework.  
Devs will finally have a place to set new internet standards for Web3 needs

Once your Special Extension in made, the entire Web3 internet will be easily able to benefit from it on-fly  
Building a Web3site following the Orivon model for a dev means building within a powerful ecosystem with both ease of build and User Experience, which incentivizes huge waves of users into your product


## Orivon Implementation

It's the moment to dive deep into how Orivon actually works and how it aims to solve all of this problems and drastically improve the User Experience

Please note that the Orivon Development process has yet to begin  
If you want to get Involved and reserve a place inside Orivon and our DAO please check the [**Get involved**](involving) page

More implementation details of specific components are available at [**Implementations**](category/implementations)  
But first, if you already didn't, take a look at the main features

### Applications <small style={{ display: "block", marginTop: 0, fontWeight: "normal", fontSize: "0.50em", lineHeight: 1.2, marginBottom: "-3em"}}> Also called special extensions </small>

Web3 is not just about supporting IPFS or a decentralized domain, it's about owning capabilities, other than IPFS we may want to use Arweave, Torrent, the Ethereum blockchain etc... Here's where the Applications system comes

Almost every component is possibly extended or modified by Apps, they can be installed as easily as browser extensions or ran on-fly opening a url, and they goes for:
- **Dashboard:** The application used to show up the Dashboard in new tabs of the browser - [*Orivon Dashboard*](implementations/dashboard-app)
- **DNS resolution** - [*details*](implementations/dns-resolution)
- **Data Gathering** (ex. IPFS, Arweave, Blockchain etc...) - [*details*](implementations/data-gathering)
- **Accounts:** an account may be based on mnemonic, hardware wallet, abstracted or anything else by App logic
- **Crypto:** implementing a new crypto like Monero, BSQ Tokens, etc... 
- **Address list:** implementing a new address list out of an implemented ***Crypto*** for all compatible ***Accounts***, it could be the default address list itself, or vanity address generator, or anything else by app logic
- **Network** (ex. implementing access for Bitcoin network, Tor network, IPFS Node, Torrent, Bisq pricenode etc...)
- **Web3 Score provider:** one or more providers can provide the data for the [trustlessity and security scores](#trustlessity--security-score) during the user activity

The [*Wallet system*](implementations/wallet-system) component shares an interesting point for DeFi users, which are DApps for Crypto that has never been trustlessly possible from a website: Bitcoin, Monero, ZCash, BSQ etc...  

That's going to open doors for DApps at Atomic Swaps, Escrow transactions with multisig or time-lock and way more

### Web3 Scores: Trustlessity & Security

<img src={Web3scores} alt="Web3scores" width="350"/>
<small style={{ display: "block", marginBottom: "1rem"  }}>Take this only as an experimental and illustrative image</small>

Trustlessity and Security scores are features which allows users to have an easy understanding of what they are using, it easly allows to understand:

- How trustless and actually Web3 this is?
- How realistically safe this specific operation is?
- (bonus) Is that reasonably privacy preserving?

Imagine the user who asks "Is this site trustless? Is it Web3?"  
If it's a .com site it's *not trustless*  
If it's a .eth connected to IPFS yes  
But if it gives you a bank IBAN to receive money without informing the user about the non-trustlessity of it, it's not trustless.  
If without user control it relies on data from centralized parties, it's not trustless, simple as that.

Furthermore user needs to know the safety of the Operation he is performing, maybe you can yeld some trustless stablecoin for a 400% estimated annual income, *but it doesn't mean it's safe*

These 2 scores improves the user sense of safety dramatically, it's a game changer to bring huge trust into the Web3 field, with honest and realistic evaluations playing a key role on that

[So, who gives the evaluations?](implementations/web3-score)

[How evaluations system works?](implementations/web3-score)


### Advanced WASM: Programs on-fly

Current browsers limitations forces most of Web3 codebases to get independent and build their own separate program

That's because browsers like Chrome or Firefox does not allow access to important **network functions** (which would allow to open a bitcoin node, or just connecting to Torrent), extremely limited **storage access**, limited **cpu/gpu** access which is sometimes needed for speed and optimization purposes, and some other **OS Functions**  

Orivon aims to implement the access of these needed functions in a controlled and safe environment so that most of Web3 codebases can run as a web3site just by opening a url

It translates into run a true Bitcoin Node on a bitcoinnode.eth, use Torrent just by opening torrentclient.eth, use the original Mastodon client at mastodon.eth, use bisq on a bisq.eth, using a Tor connection just trough torproxy.eth, and way way way more, there is an ocean of possibilities, it really breaks the perception of how we interact with Web3 today entirely  

It's a basilar concept that should be the default on Web3 field, and ***once you see it you can't unsee it***

#### For developers

You are completely free to use any language you want as long it supports WASM compiling

As for the frontend part, it's exactly the same as the nowadays frontend developing, you can use HTML and it's related tools, or keep using WASM to use instead Canvas/WebGL/WebGPU

That means that bitcoind of [bitcoin-core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) would be already runnable as a site on Orivon, and it would require just to write a web frontend to interact with it


### Other features

#### Web3 Applications store

Orivon will feature a store specifically for [Applications](#applications--also-called-special-extensions-) which expands the browser capabilities

As the [Web3 Score](./implementations/web3-score), if someone else comes before us on building a better store with suitable Trustlessity, Security and Privacy, we will adopt that as default

Otherwise, we will build it

Implementation details of a store aren't still been made, to contribute propose in our [docs repo](https://github.com/OrivonBrowser/orivon-docs) or connect in our [discord](https://discord.gg/DuRg87MvgD)  
Anyway we plan it to have the following foundations: 

- The store should prioritize the results with best [Web3 Scores](implementations/web3-score) based on browser Providers
- The entire store should be considered enough Trustless, Secure and Privacy conserving
- UI and Features inspired by F-Droid

#### Web3 Search

Web3 Search engines will be already integrated, possibly engines mixing Web2 and Web3 with a focus on prioritizing [Web3 Score](implementations/web3-score)

We have some example candidates which we may opt to collaborate with in the future  
These are: [web3compass](https://www.web3compass.net/) and [0xapps](https://0xapps.com/), but as right now, take them just as examples

If nothing will fit Orivon needs, we will be open to create our own Web3 Search engine

#### Installable Web3sites

By definition, if you are a Web3site it's because you're trustless, meaning that it can be run completely locally

Then, downloaded or not, you're always in control of it's Special Extension components, such as Network, Data Gathering, Crypto implementations etc... 

#### DDOC

***D**omain **D**ata **O**wnership **C**onfirmation*

DDOC can be seen as an additional security layer after HTTPS, it serves to verify that the data you received are exactly what the domain owner wanted you to receive

It prevents incidents caused by remote server hacking and assures Data Integrity  

DDOC requirement *can* be meet by conventional Hosts/IP data gathering (see [Native DDOC Support](./implementations/native-ddoc-specs)), or by design from protocols (like IPFS)

That's the doorway to let Web3 Score verifications possible, since an identification string will be always available when DDOC is meet, lack of DDOC makes site data unpredictable, so there is no way to declare their respective safety


#### Connection Settings

Orivon will add 2 new options in settings

*Nodes Configuration*, each Network App can add their field in nodes configuration, to manage things like, what node to use, run a node, and choose the way the node is going to be ran, which is:

- Directly from that Network App itself (if supported)
- Find and/or use another App/Site capable of running that node

*Socks5 Configuration* Apps can both create and use Socks5 proxyes  
Apps providing Socks5 Proxy will be shown with their icon when needed, but custom Socks5 proxy (by IP Address) can still be chosen 

You can also set a Socks5 proxy for the entire browser, but App proxy settings does override it anyway

## Get Involved in Orivon

Orivon is a community supported project, it's placing as a Browser willing change the entire Web3 ecosystem with new standards, and then get adopted worldwide, for that reason Orivon has to be backed by a big and valuable community. Orivon is the community.

It does not matter what your skills currently are, what matter most is that you're willing to commit your efforts into supporting Orivon  

There are very valuable roles which you can take, once you get involved your efforts will be kept, paid out with a fair amount of governance tokens into the Orivon DAO once it will be finally launched
