# About Mobile

Currently we haven't a public design of how Orivon should exactly look like on Mobile

In the meanwhile, our current technical basics are thought and made with the long term goal to be already compatible with it

Developers of Web3sites, Apps and Integrations should not worry, your code will be able to run on Mobile devices once Orivon will support these, the only major headache for community devs will be Frontend adaptations, which are obvious and inevitable

We will update this page once a clearer plan on Mobile will be established
