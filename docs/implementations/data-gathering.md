# Data Gathering
Apps can implement support for different ways to actually load a website from the DNS Records

Some examples may be loading trough IPFS, IP but with proxy, Arweave, Ethereum chain, Install it from github and run to load it locally (that last one is a crazy shot, but take it as an example)

Priority of which App should try to load first can be changed in settings, or temporarily on-the-fly from the toolbar, if an App fails to load a site, the work will be handled to the next one lower in priority

These Apps has the task of establishing if during the navigation on the website DDOC is verified or not and communicate it to the Browser
