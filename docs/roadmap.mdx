# Roadmap

The goal of the Orivon Project is to revolutionize the entire Web3 Ecosystem, with a new set of Web standards for average internet usage, to lead it to the Web3 worldwide adoption

Here we talk about the current state of Orivon and our Roadmap, so that you can orientate better in our project

## Current state

As today that's what Orivon has successfully built:

- ***This documentation***, enabling the share of the Orivon phylosophy and knowledge to the community in Web3 space

- ***Elite team***, we have a small elite of very motivated peoples (5) which got involved into the project and we aim to expand it even more, supporting Orivon in this vital moment assures you a good share of it in future, both in our DAO and eventual company  
You can check more in [***Get Involved***](involving) and our [***Discord***](https://discord.gg/DuRg87MvgD) server

- ***Partnership***, with 1 project ([WowSeoWeb3](https://wowseoweb3.com/))

- ***Orivon Forum***, ready to talk about standards to enstablish into the Orivon ecosystem, available [**here**](https://orivonstack.com)

- ***X / Twitter channel***, available [***here***](https://x.com/OrivonBrowser)

## Our current goal

In the moment you are reading this, our goal is to affirm the name of Orivon into the Web3 space

Such a thing will translate to actual approval for the Orivon phylosophy from the Web3 ecosytem, leading to high chances of success once the browser is actually made up

While the Orivon name will be successfully affirmed in the Web3 space, getting high value Partnerships, Contributions, Developers, Grants and Fundings will come pretty spontaneously, and the project will begin it's way into being realized and getting truly real with an high quality product

## The Roadmap

Here is our Roadmap:

- ~~***Defining project core phylosophy and idea***~~ <small>Accomplished with this documentation</small>

- ***Enstablishing a solid Elite Team*** <small>Work in progress...</small> **->**  
<small>We need at least 10 highly invested involveds which actively works at Orivon</small>

- ***Building a solid community*** **->**  
<small>Includes affirming enough a certain amount of quality community members in our channels, indicative number: 200</small>

- ***Enstablish the name of Orivon on Web3*** **->**  
<small>Enstablishing solid support and partnerships from well known projects, recognition  
from key players and general trust from the Web3 world towards Orivon</small>

- ***Get Funding*** **->**  
<small>By the Orivon nature itself, funding is a strong signal of approval from the Web3 ecosystem, it  
means that the Orivon model is accepted and will probably work, so that's the way to go</small>

- **Build Orivon Browser**

## Funding process

There is a lot of way into the "***Get Funding***" process

Basically we plan to open doors to Funding once a very solid developing team with a solid action plan is ready to be reunited and put hands into the project

Funding will come in different stages, before the last big one to actually build The Orivon Browser

We plan to split the funding in 3 stages:

 - ***Intial test grant (20.000 - 60.000$):*** That initial small grant serves to prove that the Orivon team is able to keep up with promised goals and will finance the development of core essentials components of Orivon enough to offer the firsts functional and visual MVP's proofs

 - ***Product core funding (80.000 - 250.000$)***: Our goal with that funding stage is to create an actually reliable enough product which is able to prove the Orivon value to users, integration with various Apps and Web3 system will prove the effectiveness of the Orivon model, an experimental release to play with will be available

 - ***Launch funding (300.000$ - 750.000$)***: This is considered the final funding required to make the Orivon Browser become officially true, it includes a stable SDK for community devs Integrations, stable browser release along with all of the promised features  

    Then, it's the most important part for the minds behind Orivon to effectively spread the browser to the masses (both to Web3, devs, and users) and we take responsibility to do it in the most effective way

Additional fundings plans futher these could be available to boost long term mantainement or to apply further projects milestones strategic to the Orivon interests

We have the interest into futher innovation for Web3 after the original Orivon Browser will be made up


## How are we achieving the current goal

There are a lot of things currently going on to reach our next milestone into the Roadmap, here we explain our current strategy

We are in the "***Enstablishing a solid Elite Team***" phase.  
Which means that we want to enstablish first a solid active team backing the Orivon way into success


### Growth

We apply various Growth Stategy within our team which allow us to find new key connections and partnerships into Web3 space and get them to join with Orivon

In the meanwhile, new peoples means new feedbacks, new ideas and clearer image of what Orivon is missing, which translates into more opportunity for us to expand and improve our documentation, meaning that our foundations becomes always more solid as time passes

If you are getting into Orivon, you will be happy to hear that you're helping into this process of foundations strengthening


### Developers work

Even tho it does not immediatly contribute with our current Roadmap goal, this part is still strategic to keep up, it will be needed in the long term anyway and can indirectly boost the instruments available for Community Growth

Devs are employed into sharing thougs and opinions about the technical side, evidencing flaw, creating concepts test and test implementations (like [native-ddoc-lib](https://github.com/OrivonBrowser/native-ddoc-lib))

Once deeper technical basics are published here in the docs, doors will open to even better discussions by devs for Orivon

Discussion and research this topic is not just about "Orivon", but is a discussion on, how, the future of an internet, integrating the Web3, should look like

It's considered public contribute for public goods
Orivon is just someone who leads that and tries to take it to realty in it's best shape possible

Now, the main place to contribute on that discussion is inside our [***Discord***](https://discord.gg/DuRg87MvgD) server

Open Source Orivon countributions available in our [***OrivonBrowser Github***](https://github.com/OrivonBrowser)
